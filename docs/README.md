# vylrhg Super App Documentation

LLM-oriented documentation. Precision > readability. Files are structured as a recursive tree. Every directory contains a README.md that is a table of contents for that subtree.

## Index

- [overview/](overview/README.md)
- [architecture/](architecture/README.md)
- [runtime/](runtime/README.md)
- [renderer/](renderer/README.md)
- [ui/](ui/README.md)
- [languages/](languages/README.md)
- [operations/](operations/README.md)
- [roadmap/](roadmap/README.md)
- [reference/](reference/README.md)

## Conventions

- Directory names are semantic, not chronological.
- Each README is a subtree index.
- Use explicit terminology and avoid implicit assumptions.
- Prefer small, composable files; each file is scoped to a single concept.
