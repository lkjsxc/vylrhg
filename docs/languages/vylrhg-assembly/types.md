# Types

## Core Rules

- Statically typed with explicit type annotations.
- No implicit widening; coercions are explicit.

## Primitive Types

- int, float, bool, char, symbol.

## Compound Types

- tuple, array, struct, enum.

## Managed Types

- ref<T>, list<T>, map<K,V>.
- Managed types are traced by the GC.
