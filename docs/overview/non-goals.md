- Provide compatibility layers for legacy markup, CSS, or HTML.
- Support dynamic runtime patching or hot-swappable modules.
- Permit uncontrolled side effects outside explicit effect APIs.
- Maintain compatibility between unstable versions.
- Guarantee plugin safety for arbitrary third-party code.
