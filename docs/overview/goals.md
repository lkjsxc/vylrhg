# Goals

- Deterministic async scheduling using tokio primitives.
- Tiling layout engine supporting nested splits and dynamic reflow.
- Multi-tab model with persistent session state and multiplexing.
- Assembly and markup designed for static typing and zero attributes.
- Renderer pipeline that parses markup and executes assembly in a unified VM.
- Minimal external dependencies; implement core subsystems from scratch.
